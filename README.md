This app is designed as a stress-testing and demonstration platform for backend operations. Users can request a one-time-use API key or token, which they can use to trigger a series of test operations.

Once authenticated with the one-time token, the user will be able to perform operations against a range of numeric values from 0 to X, where X is configurable. These operations simulate realistic API usage patterns and workloads.

The app will collect and display real-time or post-run statistics such as:

Number of successful operations

Latency per request

Error/failure rates

Rate limits or throttling behavior

As implementation progresses, more features and test types can be added to simulate a variety of use cases (e.g., write-heavy, read-heavy, burst traffic, etc.).

This project is in active development, and the idea will continue to evolve based on experimentation and feedback.
